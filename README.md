# 🏦 Banking System in C++

A **console-based Banking System** built in C++ that demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **STL containers** like `map`.  

This project was created as a practical application after completing the **Learn C++ Programming - Beginner to Advance - Deep Dive in C++** course by **Abdul Bari** (30.5 hours, Udemy).

## 🚀 Features
- Open a new bank account  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money (with minimum balance check)  
- Balance enquiry  
- Close an account  
- Show all accounts  
- Persistent storage using `Bank.data`  

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects**  
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction**  
- **Operator Overloading (`<<`, `>>`)**  
- **File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)**  
- **STL Map for account storage**  
- **Exception Handling (Insufficient Funds)**

✨ Would you like me to also create a **short professional GitHub repo tagline** (the one-line text that shows under your repo title) so it looks even more polished when recruiters or peers see it?
